# Bootstrapping

Sometimes, using bootstrapping to get a confidence intervals can solve problems of statistical inference. But there appears to be some confusion as to how to do this. We wrote an R Markdown tutorial as well as a Jupyter notebook (for Python) that both roughly cover how to do this. For R users, we suggest cloning the repo as an R Studio project. Python users can just download the ipynb file, or see how it works on our Google collab verion:
